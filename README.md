Aspiring **Full Stack Software Engineer** determined to find a role in which I can add value and grow to become a world class software engineer. As a recent graduate of a leading software development boot camp, [Makers](https://makers.tech/), I strive to adhere to practices such as TDD/BDD and adopt an Agile development approach. Currently I am focused on enhancing my proficiency in building full stack JavaScript applications with frameworks such as React and Node.

Previously I was pursuing a career in accounting where being meticulous was crucial to relaying the correct information. I decided that I wanted to transfer my skills to an industry where I can continuously utilize and broaden my abilities. Out of curiosity, I experimented with writing code on websites such as codeacademy and freecodecamp and found that I enjoy solving logical problems. I concluded that I would thrive in an industry where building useful things and experimenting with new technologies was the norm.

With the intention to dive head first into the tech industry, I attended Makers, where I learned that not everything can be solved on your own, rather a collaborative effort is fundamental to problem solving.

## Skills


#### Self-Driven Independent Learner

When I chose the path of a software engineer, I did so with the idea that it must become my bread and butter and concluded that programming is a skill that I must endeavor to master. My single page front-end [Twitter Clone](https://github.com/kirtimansingh93/chitter-frontend) with a pre-prepared backend API is an example Iâ€™m proud of.  Although my JavaScript knowledge was fairly limited at the time, I wanted to pursue it using JavaScript. I taught myself JavaScript basics, followed by asynchronous javascript and DOM manipulation. I continuously seek to better myself by taking courses on udemy and reading books about software craftsmanship and object oriented design.

I am also currently teaching myself how to invest in the Share Market. By learning online and reading books on technical analysis, I have become a much more confident trader. I have found the "chat with traders" podcast extremely insightful where various traders provide valuable advice for those who are self learning as well as on how to develop a trader's psychology. Another book that has taught me a lot on technical analysis is "How to Make Money in Stocks" by William J. O'Neil, where the author analyzes the biggest moves of US stocks in the last century and explains what chart patterns were common to these movements. I have managed to grow my portfolio by almost 50% over 6 months, having made about 3000 GBP in profit.


#### Effective Communicator

My experience of working with other people range from being insistent with group members at Makers regarding having regular meetings to either, catch members up with the progress of the project or slow members down from going off on a tangent to the objective. I achieved this by holding daily stand-ups and retrospectives, as well as using trello to create tickets, so that each person knew what they were doing, what others were doing and what needed to be done.

I led the cricket society at University alongside fellow team members, to coordinate events with other clubs and societies and arranging matches or tournaments with other nearby cricket clubs and universities. In my opinion, it is important to be both considerate as well as honest towards others in order to maintain a healthy work relationship.


#### Detail Oriented

As an accounts intern, the ability to manipulate data accurately requires constant focus on the task at hand. When looking at a client's bank statements and invoices, and recording the transactions into ledger accounts, I must double check to insure that the data is correct, or the accounts won't balance. This is similar to debugging code where a small error can result in the program not running as intended. I have developed the habit of double checking my code to check whether I have not made any accidental errors and deciphering error messages in order to effectively amend my code.

I believe that attention to detail is the difference between mediocre results and great results.  I have witnessed the most improvements in any physical exercise, whether it be yoga or playing a sport, by paying close attention to my form/technique. Learning correct technique of table tennis made me a considerably more consistent player, and focusing on correct alignment during yoga poses helped me progress onto more difficult poses.
